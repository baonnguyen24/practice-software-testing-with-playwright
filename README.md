## Playwright Test Automation - Code-Along Project

This hands-on project is part of a code-along series led by **John Ferguson Smart** (author of *BDD in Action*). It gave me the chance to brush up on modern automation skills with Playwright, while applying best practices like **Page Object Models** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**.

### 🧠 What I practiced:
- 🔁 Refreshed core Playwright concepts
- 🎯 Used a variety of powerful locators
- 🌐 Worked with API testing
- 🧱 Structured tests using the Page Object Model
- 🧪 Built automation scenarios with Cucumber and BDD
- 📊 Integrated beautiful reports using Allure
- ✨ And so much more...
